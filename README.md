# Deep Learning Churn Modeling

My first NN using Deep Learning to resolve a Churn Modeling problem

## How to run

Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`
```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the script:
```shell
python main.py
```

If the model is already created, it will load it and run it. 
Otherwise, it will train a new model for later use.
